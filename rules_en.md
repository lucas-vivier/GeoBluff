# GeoBluff Rules

## Goal
Get rid of all your cards first.

## Setup
- Each team receives 7 country cards
- A reference card is placed at the center of the board
- A category is drawn at random (Population, Area, GDP)
- Team 1 starts the game

## Turn flow
1. On your turn, select a card from your hand
2. Place it on the board at the desired position (left or right of existing cards)
3. Cards must be ordered from the smallest value (left) to the largest (right)
4. Confirm your placement or cancel to choose another card
5. Then it is the opponent's turn

## Player order
- Team 1 plays first at the start of the game
- Teams then alternate turns
- After a bluff, the losing team starts the new round

## Bluff
- Before playing, you can shout "BLUFF!" if you think the order is wrong
- You can only call a bluff if there are at least 2 cards on the board
- Click the cards one by one to reveal their values
- If the order was correct: you draw 2 cards and start the new round
- If the order was wrong: the opponent draws 2 cards and starts the new round
- A new round starts with a new category and a new reference card

## Category change
- At the beginning of a round (before any cards are placed), you can request a category change
- A new category is then drawn at random

## Victory
- When you play your last card, you must name its capital
- Correct answer = Victory!
- The opponent can accept a close answer (e.g., "Pekin" instead of "Beijing")
- Wrong answer refused = you draw 2 cards and the game continues

## Draw pile
- If you need to draw but there are no cards left, you draw nothing
